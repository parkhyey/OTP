# One-time pad (OTP)
Creating five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. These programs combine the multi-processing code with socket-based inter-process communication. The programs are also accessible from the command line using standard Unix features like input/output redirection, and job control. A short compilation script is included.
